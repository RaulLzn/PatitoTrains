# Passenger Train Management System

This project is a system developed in Java to manage passenger trains. It uses JavaFX for user interfaces, RMI for server-client communication, implements custom data structures, and uses JSON as a database to manage information.

## Features

- **Modules:**
  - **Centralized Server:** Responsible for managing communication between different modules and clients.
  - **Administration Module:** Allows managing information related to trains, routes, and schedules.
  - **Ticket Management Module:** Facilitates the purchase and management of tickets by users.
  - **Boarding Module:** Manages the boarding of passengers onto the trains.

- **Graphs and Algorithms:**
  - Graphs are used to represent train routes.
  - Implementation of algorithms to calculate the shortest route, regardless of the passenger's location.

- **Technologies used:**
  - **JavaFX:** For user interfaces.
  - **RMI:** For client-server communication.
  - **JSON:** As a database to store and manage information.
